# Voix

Voix is a creative language translator built for the GAI2 Hackathon. It goes beyond simple, literal translation to preserve the original meaning, tone, and style of your content. Whether you're translating between languages or transforming your writing style, Voix is designed to maintain the nuance and voice of your text.

### **Core Features**

* **Multilingual Translation**: Translate text between at least two languages (e.g., English â†” Spanish).
* **Style Transformation**: Transform text style while preserving meaning (e.g., formal to casual, prose to poetry).
* **Tone Preservation**: Our AI model is designed to maintain the original tone and intent of the source text in the output.
* **Customizable Output**: You can specify your desired target style or dialect for a more tailored result.
